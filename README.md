# Java-several-excercises
This repo contains solutions to five excercises in Java from my studies. The objective was to learn and practice the basics of the Java language, its application into webs and databases, also the MVC architecture, and Java coding conventions. The initial problem, purposed for the model of the program, was integral calculating. <br>
<p><b>IntegralCalculation</b> - basic console application consisting of controller, view, model solving the integration problem, and custom exception.</p>
<p><b>IntegralCalculation2.0</b> - improved version of the first program, using standard collections, a generic type, annotations, and other techniques. Unit tests of the model are defined too.</p>
<p><b>IntegralCalculationTCP-IP</b> - consists of two seperate projects, one for server, and the other one for the client of the application. The application uses TCP/IP protocol to transfer data between client and server so that the server processes calculations in the model and responds to client's requests.</p>
<p><b>IntegralCalculationServlets</b> - simple web application running on localhost that uses HttpServlet class to respond to client's requests.</p>
<p><b>IntegralCalculationDB</b> - extended version of IntegralCalculationServlets, adding a database on localhost that stores the history of performed calculations, also available to be read by the client.</p>
